# What it's useful for

`npm audit` is a tool that performs a moment-in-time security review of your
projectâ€™s dependency tree and can help you fix a vulnerability.

-   Always make sure your dependencies are getting scanned for latest security
    vulnerabilities
-   Get help to fix those vulnerabilities by receiving pull requests with updates
-   Apply same security review policy across your entire organization
-   Exclude certain dependencies from auditing and upgrades

When there are no security vulnerabilities in a project, this skill can optionally
help to keep dependencies current and up-to-date.
